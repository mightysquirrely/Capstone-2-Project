**Problem Statement:**
  There are many factors that impact the health and wellness of human society.  It should be possible to reduce the occurrence of particular health concerns if those factors with high impact can be identified. The goal of this project is to use statistical inference and machine learning to explore if predictions in certain illnesses can be made related to habits, nutrition, BMI, and bloodwork.  

**Proposed Solution:**
  Perform exploratory analysis and predictive modeling from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) dataset that assesses the health and nutritional status of people in the United States.     
Accurate predictive models can help people in general to benefit if looking for ways to better their life.
It can extend to professionals in the medical, nutritional, and fitness arenas to discuss the potential effects of life choices relating to health conditions. 
This could lead to people wanting to research particular findings in more depth in order to better their lives.  Potentially adding longevity and making a positive difference for our population at large.

**Conclusions:**

A scatterplot analysis for participants identified with arthritis indicates lower platelet and Creatine Phosphokinase(CPK) counts. Based on this visual alone, a hyphotheses statement such that a participant with low levels of CPK and low platelet counts have a good chance of being told by a health professional that they have arthritis. Further the plot suggests that higher counts for both CPK and platelets relates to those not being diagnosed with arthritis. 

A confusion matrix and kmeans clustering technique were used to look at participants with asthma.  The classification rate is around 55%, which is good accuracy in that it is more than 50%.
