**Problem Statement:**
  There are many factors that impact the health and wellness of human society.  It should be possible to reduce the occurrence of particular health concerns if those factors with high impact can be identified. The goal of this project is to use statistical inference and machine learning to explore if predictions in certain illnesses can be made related to habits, nutrition, BMI, and bloodwork.  

**Proposed Solution:**
  Perform exploratory analysis and predictive modeling from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) dataset that assesses the health and nutritional status of people in the United States.     
Accurate predictive models can help people in general to benefit if looking for ways to better their life.
It can extend to professionals in the medical, nutritional, and fitness arenas to discuss the potential effects of life choices relating to health conditions. 
This could lead to people wanting to research particular findings in more depth in order to better their lives.  Potentially adding longevity and making a positive difference for our population at large.

**Conclusions:**

Arthritis
The participants with low levels of creatine phosphokinase and low platelet counts have a good chance of being told by a health professional that they have arthritis. Further, it suggests that higher counts for both creatine phosphokinase and platelets relates to those not being diagnosed with arthritis.

Correlations
The study suggests that people who have vigorous and moderate intensity type of active work, often walk or bicycle for transportation.  It further suggests that people who drank milk during their younger years have little connection to whether they drink milk now.  

Asthma
The participants with asthma ranked higher in particular categories from this study.  It is seen in the k-means clustering findings.  This indicates that indeed it cannot be ruled out that particular categories influence having asthma such as levels of creatine phosphokinase, chemical pesticide and weed kill use, sedentary activity in a day, using milk regularly, and BMI at age 25.
